This project is for the XP Days Ukraine 2017 conference, and represents the first state of code for the "Improving Your Organization’s Technical Prowess With Legacy Code Retreats" talk.

Please do not judge me on this code alone. ☺ 

This code is designed to be an example of legacy code that works, but is nothing that we are proud of and pretty hard to maintain.

#### The goal at this point is to:
* Be careful with the code - anything we do may make it shatter into a thousand shards that may be very difficult to reassemble.
* Understand what the code does and how it does it.  Probe it a bit.  Run it in the debugger if necessary to better understand what it is doing.
* Get us to a point where we will feel comfortable writing some automated tests in the next phase.
